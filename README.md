# About The Project
With our user-friendly website, identifying plants has never been easier. Just upload a photo of a plant, and our "smart" AI will quickly tell you its name and characteristics. 

Create an account to unlock the Garden Companion feature. Each plant you identify gets saved in your personal garden album. You can even add notes, like watering schedules or care tips, to keep your plants healthy and thriving.

Explore the world of plants with "PlantSnap Garden Companion" â€“ your go-to tool for all things green!

In short:
* Upload a plant and it'll tell you the name and some basic info. ðŸŒ¼
* You can create an account to make your own garden ðŸŒ¼
* You can add notes to each plant. ðŸŒ¼

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
